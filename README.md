# Product Properties Bulk Updater for RESTful API in Shopware

This Python script leverages the power of Shopware's RESTful API to perform bulk updates to product properties. It's designed to simplify the process of managing large product catalogs by enabling the batch editing of product properties, thereby eliminating the need for tedious, time-consuming manual updates.

# Usage

Replace placeholders in the script with your own Shopware instance URL, API credentials, and product data that you want to update.

Note: Always ensure that you have a backup of your data before running any kind of bulk update operation.
